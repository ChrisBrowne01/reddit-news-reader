# Reddit News Reader

## Overview

This project was built as a Reddit application using everything I've learned, including React and Redux. Reddit is a website where people share links to articles, media and other things on the web. This Reddit API provides data which will allow users to view and search posts and comments, up vote and down vote which are provided by fetching Reddit API data.

## Wireframes

Below are wireframes of the initial design for the project:

    - Header ~ The user can search the data using terms
    - Subreddits ~ The user can filter the data based on categories that are predefined.
    - Home ~ Users see an initial view of the data when first visiting the app

[Wire frame capition to be added]


## Technologies used

The project uses the following technologies:

    **Languages Used:**
    - HTML ~ Used to provide the user with a cohesive design system structure
    - CSS ~ Used to provide the user with a cohesive design style, animations and transitions
    - JavaScript ~ Used to develop to handle data fetching, rendering UI components, and managing state
    - React ~ Used to create a dynamic, interactive, and reusable user interface.
    - Redux/Toolkit - To create the components of the website.
    - Jest and Enzyme ~ To write unit tests for the components.
    - Wireframing ~ [Reddit Brand Guidlines](https://www.redditinc.com/assets/press-resources/reddit_brand_guidelines_202009-3.pdf) (PDF) Use to develop an application that uses the colour scheme of Reddit and for design layout ideas.
    - Git and GitHub ~ Used for GIt Version Control and GItHub for deployment and publishing of the Reddit News Reader application online. This link can be found at [Reddit News Reader](https://github.com/ChrisBrowne01/reddit-news-reader.git)
